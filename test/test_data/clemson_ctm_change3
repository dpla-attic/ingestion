Beattie as vice-president; during the 1930s, Monaghan stopped being a cotton mill and began weaving fabrics from synthetic yarns; in 1946, Victor-Monaghan Company, combined the Monaghan Mills and the Apalache, Greer, and Victor Plants in Greer, S.C. and brought into J.P.

    "description": "Slater : a proud textile community in South Carolina and the most famous name in American textile history; a brief historical sketch of the Slater Plant from 1927-1993; H. Nelson Slater, III, in 1923, became president of S. Slater and Sons, Inc.; a site in upper Greenville County, South Carolina was selected, with a cornerstone from the original Slater Mill in Rhode Island laid on October 15, 1927 to establish the new Slater plant; the site was suggested by the Greenville engineering firm J.E. Sirrine, designed to make rayon-filled Alpacas; the working community originally lived in 140 houses that became the foundation of the Slater-Marietta; Slater experimented with products such as woven, cotton-dyed yarn shirting and during the late 1930s converted to a rayon and acetate weaving unit; Slater became part of J.P. Stevens & Co., Inc. in 1946 as part of the Stevens Synthetics Fabric Division; the plant had grown to 185,000 square feet of floor space; experimentation continued with weaving of glass fiber yarns and the real entry into the glass market was in 1951 with a weaving program of fiber glass marquisette; by 1960 Slater became a 100 percent fiber glass plant; In 1988, the Slater Plant became part of a subsidiary of JPS Textiles known as JPS Converter & Industrial Corp; the plants operation was advanced again in 1990 when $1.8 million was authorized by the Stevens successors with 60 percent of that total going into high speed weaving machines and the rest in Cabler type twisters; beginning in 1964, the Slater Plant quartz fabrics to the aerospace industry and used in composites for rocket nose cones, rocket engine nozzle liners, radomes, and in high temperature insulation systems; In the late 60s, J.P. Stevens, working with NASA and ILC Space Systems, developed a specialized Beta-Fiberglass fabric for use by the Apollo astronauts; the addition of computerized Dornier rapier looms in 1990 was a step to improve the quality and productivity of quartz fabrics\n",
