    This module makes a simple conversion of the values from the `prop` path,
    using dictionary described with `substitution` argument, and stores it in
    the `target` path. The description of using prop and target path is below.

    Args:
        body (Str): JSON with structure to change.
        prop (Str): Path for reading the value.
        target (Str): Path for storing the value.
        substitution (Str): Name of the dicionary read from akara.conf.
        delnonexisting (Bool): Flag used for deleting a field if it doesn't
                               exist in dictionary.

    The paths must be divided using "/".

    The prop must point to an existing dictionary, however there can be lists
    in the hierarchy, see the examples below.

    The target must point the same dictionary as prop path, however the last
    part of the target path can be missing. In this case it will be created.
    If it exists, then the value can be replaced.

    The `prop` and `target` paths must be similar and can differ only with the
    last parts.

    Example of similar fields:
        "a/b/c" - "a/b/x"
        "a/b"   - "a/b"
        "a"     - "a"

    Example of not similar fields:
        "a/b/c" - "a/b/c/d"
        "a/b/c" - "a/x/x"
        "a"     - "a/b"

    The substitution argument is used for getting the name of the variable
    from lookup_mapping dictionary akara.conf. Then this dictionary is used
    for conversion.

    If the value for conversion is not a key in the conversion dictionary, then
    no conversion is made.

    Searching dictionary.

    The `prop` path is used for getting the dictionary to read value for conversion.
    The lookup modules supports lists as well, if there is a list in the dictionaries
    hierarchy, then all the dictionaries/values are converted.

    Examples:
        Assume that the dictionary used for conversion is:
            {"a": "A",
             "b": "B",
             "c": "C"}
